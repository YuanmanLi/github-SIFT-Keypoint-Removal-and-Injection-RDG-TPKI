The code for the paper "SIFT Keypoint Removal via Directed Graph Construction for Color Images"
The code also provides the component of injection algorithm TPKI. 
The code works for multiple octaves

Run main.m script to get the results for those 8 test images. 
Run gray_to_rgb.m to transform the grayscale image to color one.

Note that component of anti copy-move detecor is not included in this release. 
It is not difficult, only remove those matched ones (in the cloned patches) and leave others untouched.
Interested readers can send us emails for the code.   (yuanmanx.li@gmail.com)
